# Reddport
This is a fork of sorts from our now defunct Reddit vote manipulation system. This will require you to initially create an account through the tor network in order to complete the captcha, but this will login and allow you to report everything on a certain subreddit in order to piss off the mods. 

I've never seen how the Reddit admins respond to report abuse so this will be interesting when it all goes down. Because everyone on Reddit loves me already /s. 

## TODO

- Actually implement reporting correctly. This will mean having to create a subreddit in order to test the reporting function. 
- Fix shadowban checking


## Changes from Drownvote

- I actually got around to implementing pretty print correctly how thaweatherman originally intended it.
- I also use fake-useragent instead of generating my own to improve anonymity
